Used dataset related to Horse Health reading in various Hospitals.

Compare Accuracy performance of Decision Tree and Random Forest.

Had to use get_dummies of pandas to convert categorical data to numerical ones.

Used preprocession function of LabelEncoder to encode categorical target values to numeric.

At last trained and tested both classifiers: Decision Tree and Random Forest.

Found Random Forest Accuracy is always better than Decision tree not matter how we tune the feed data.
